# Recipes (playbooks)

## Kata: Social Network (incremental)
- Slice by slice: Posting → Reading → Following → Wall
- Enforce FIC between slices
- Keep IO out of unit tests (inject Clock, repositories)

## Kata: Gilded Rose (refactoring)
- Start with characterization tests (golden master if needed)
- Refactor mechanically (extract function, rename)
- Introduce rules by item type only after tests are solid
